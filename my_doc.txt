3 func: 1)Parse synset	2)getlabellist	3)Compute distance

Parse Synset: Reads Image net files and imageids 

2)COMPUTE DISTANCE :
		Compute the specified distance type between chanels of mean vector and query image.
    In caffe library, FC8 layer consists of 10 channels. Here, we compute distance
    of distance of each channel (from query image) with respective channel of
    Mean Activation Vector. In the paper, we considered a hybrid distance eucos which
    combines euclidean and cosine distance for bouding open space. Alternatively,
    other distances such as euclidean or cosine can also be used. 
    Input:
    --------
    query_channel: Particular FC8 channel of query image
    channel: channel number under consideration
    mean_vec: mean activation vector

    Output:
    --------
    query_distance : Distance between respective channels
